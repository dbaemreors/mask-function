# mask-function

**fullmask.sql**  

The function masks all characters in the column. It can only mask character and text data types.



**masking_except_first_and_last_character.sql**

The function masks all characters except the first and last character. I gave the function name differently to avoid confusion. It can only mask character and text data types.
